**SStemp** is a starter react template and framework for rapid development of responsive, cross platform enterprise SaaS applications.   

The objective of the project is to create a seamless connection between design, development and deployment.  

Based on a responsive web platform, weâ€™ll be working on approaches that allows rapid applications of AI powered apps on de-jure web standards for design and development.

Our Vision is to create a template and environment that spans Design--Deployment

**Design Creation**  Use tools such as Figma and others to create your design theme.  Utilize variables, styles, color palettes, typography and more.  

**Design Elements**  Utilize any popular JS or TS component library with your design tool and target a plain vanilla, responsive, react template for SaaS apps.
                                       Unstyled or styled components can be used in Figma and in this project.

**Design Prototyping**  Rapidly create a design prototype for clients in Figma and other design apps and prototype it. Export the functionality of the prototype to your own SStemp template.

**Design to Code**
--Target this SaaS app template and tech stack with your UI designs for rapid dev with or without AI
--Use AI code gen with your design deployed to SStemp
--UI design token export from Figma in JSON and CSS
--UI design export from Figma via Figma API/FigSpec; embed a figma UI design in your app
--
**Develop**  
--Use the generated code as a starting point
--Communicate app UI changes to designers via Figma and Figma API for real-time updates

**Test**

**Deploy**

**Tech Stack**
 React, Tailwind CSS, Next.js.  Flexibility to select your own Component libraries and themes.  Theme switching based on Tailwind CSS.
